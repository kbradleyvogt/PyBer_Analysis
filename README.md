# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of analysis 

This analysis reviews the data for PyBer, a ride sharing app, to create actionable insight for the leadership team. We will be digging into the relationships between the type of city we are operating in (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and the the following datapoints:
 - Total Revenue
- Driver Count
- Avg Fare per Ride
- Avg Fare per Driver

## Results

### Ride Counts by City Type 
It is no surprise that our review of ride count data shows that Urban cities have a higher count. What is interestesting is tightly distrubted the Rural ride counts are. Our only outlier exists in the Urban type, West Angela, with 39 rides. 

### Percent Breakdown by City Type
In the summary table  we can see that Urban cities have the most rides, drivers, and total fare while being the lowest cost per ride. 

In the below pie charts we cant review how total fare, total rides, and total drivers break down by city type. 
 
### Total Fare Summary by Month

## Summary 
Reviweing all the data we can start to see trends and opportunies. Much of it aligns with what you would expect from the basics of supply and demand. 

First, as we review that the percent of Urban drivers is about 81% but total fare for Urban cities is only 62.7%. If the amount of active drivers per city was capped based on a demand level, the urban drivers could see a better wage. 

Second, there are several urban cities with low driver count, low fares, but more than 20 rides. Reviewing the pricing model to ensure these drivers are being paid fairly could imporve driver adoption. It could also mean there are more full-time divers, with a higher rides per driver ratio. Either way, it is worth getting more data to understand these cities PyBer ecosystem. 

Finally, reviewing the Suburban cities we see a positive coorelation between ride number and fare price. This leads to the recommendation that expansion into more Suburban city coverage would be a smart move for PyBer.
